**Summary**: 
- The `chess` repository appears to be an object-oriented programming (OOP) final homework project
- The `chessgame` repository is labeled as "chess-2", likely representing a second version or iteration of a chess game implementation
- Both repositories contain minimal README documentation, suggesting they may be academic or personal projects in development
